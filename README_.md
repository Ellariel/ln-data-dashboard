## Topology and Network Dynamics of the Lightning Network: A Comprehensive Analysis

These are the data and scripts associated with the paper on the comprehensive analysis of the network’s topology and its temporal dynamics. The folder contains several scripts and a Dockerfile used to compute various network science metrics. The final results of these calculations are available in `results/metrics.csv` and they are merged with `make_metrics.py`. All figures from the analysis paper can be reproduced using the `make_figures.py` script.

Note that since the raw data is quite large, we did not mirror it here, but it can be directly downloaded from [(Decker, 2020)](https://github.com/lnresearch/topology). Intermediate and temporary data are also not stored here, but can be reproduced with available scripts. The snapshot reconstruction scripts are in a separate repository: https://github.com/ellariel/ln-data-preparation.

The repository includes the following calculated metrics (see `scripts/utils.py`):

 **Category**|**Metrics and attributes**                    
-------------|--------------------------
Basic Network Structure|nodes, edges (channels), components, density, diameter, shortest path length, mean degree, degree assortativity
Connectivity & Resilience|bridges, average node connectivity, minimal edge cover, transitivity, average clustering
Function & Dynamics|global efficiency, information centrality, mean betweenness centrality, communicability betweenness centrality, common neighbor centrality, constraint value, effective size, Burt's effective size, closeness vitality
Emergent Patterns|resource allocation index, Jaccard coefficient, preferential attachment, label communities (FLP), lpa communities (ALP)
Other|payment hop distribution and degree distribution approximation parameters, degree distribution entropy, Gini betweenness centrality, node intersection rate, channel intersection rate, Wiener index, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, Wasserstein distance
